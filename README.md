## Introduction

AutoCars Language Model Interface is designed to provide natural language responses based on sensor data for autonomous vehicles. Using OpenAI's models, it can generate responses such as warnings about imminent collisions or other alerts pertinent to the car's surroundings.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Python client

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install openai
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoCars.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd AutoCars
Set up your OpenAI API key. (Ensure it's kept secret)
python
Copy code
API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
Usage
Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will simulate sensor data and provide language-based decisions or warnings based on the data.
